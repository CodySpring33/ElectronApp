# ElectronApp

I am learning how to make desktop apps using Electron

Download the current release from [prereleases](https://github.com/CodySpring33/ElectronApp/releases/tag/pre-release)

This app is an online poll tracker which sources its polls from a mongodb database in which any user can vote on a given poll. 
Just run the app and some polls will pop up!
